# Here are some Geometry Dash content creators I like.

<!--
This list will be ordered as follows:

* Those near the top of the list post often, have a wide selection of existing videos, post high quality videos, post longer videos, or a combination of all of these.
* This means that inactive accounts can still rank high as long as they have a lot of videos.
* Likewise, active accounts won't rank as high if their videos are very short.
* If a creator fails in one or more of these stats, they will appear lower on the list.
* The list is ordered this way so that you can find new, good content easier.

Also, the list won't be 100% accurate. I only tried to give creators a vague positioning, so people closer together could probably be rearranged without ruining the whole list.
