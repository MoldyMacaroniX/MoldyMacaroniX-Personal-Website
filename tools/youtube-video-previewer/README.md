# YouTube Video Previewer

A tool that takes input and generates it in a way near-identical to the YouTube home page. It is useful for seeing when titles truncate and how thumbnails will look (seriously, YouTube should totally make a feature that does this). It is kind of like inspect elementâ€” actually, it pretty much *is* inspect element.

The styles are not exact and were made from nothing but a visual. But without analyzing it to oblivion, it looks pretty accurate.

Sorry for the horrible UI. I put all my efforts into the recreation, not the UI for inputting data.
