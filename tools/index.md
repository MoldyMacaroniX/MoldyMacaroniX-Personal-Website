# My Web Tools

I occasionally make little web tools for fun. They are nothing serious and are not maintained for very long.

## [Unique Idea Generator](/tools/unique-idea-generator/)

A tool that gives a random Geometry Dash level idea out of a huge selection of them. They are usually very silly or abstract, which make for super fun build challenges.

## [YouTube Video Previewer](/tools/youtube-video-previewer/)

A tool that takes user input and displays it in a way near-identical to YouTube's home page. This is particularly useful when previewing how thumbnails will look on YouTube and seeing when titles truncate.

**New:** Check out the [YouTube comment previewer](/tools/youtube-video-previewer/comment/)!
