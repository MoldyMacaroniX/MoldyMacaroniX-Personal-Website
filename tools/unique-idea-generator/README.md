# Unique Idea Generator

A tool that randomly selects a unique level idea out of a large pool of them. This is intended for Geometry Dash levels, but the ideas can also be applied elsewhere. These are usually very silly and random, which makes for fun build challenges if used in Geometry Dash.

## How it works

It is literally just a super long JSON file. That's it.
