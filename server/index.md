# MoldyMacaroniX Discord Server Rules

We require all members to follow these guidelines to create a safe and accepting environment for everyone. If you have any questions, you can ask an online server Admin.

## 1. Avoid forms of spam.

This includes, but is not limited to: sending messages at a rapid pace, irrelevant posting, randomly pinging, emote spam, impersonation, text walls, trolling, and posting content where it does not belong. Likewise, we have an enforced nicknaming system, so do not use any VIP and staff role symbols in your nicknames.

## 2. Respect your fellow members.

This means that you should be nice. As usual, any form of hate speech, harassment, personal attacks, or arguments are prohibited. We will also respect everyone no matter their gender, religion, race, or sexuality. Overall, be kind to everyone.

## 3. Avoid NSFW (not safe for work) and controversial content and discussion.

This includes but is not limited to: posting inappropriate imagery, posting unsafe links, shocking content, inappropriate avatars, inappropriate names, inappropriate custom statuses, inappropriate emotes, discussing disturbing subject matter, discussing controversial topics, and anything of the like. Likewise, do not send any malicious, deceiving, or unsafe links.

## 4. Do not harm Geometry Dash, its servers, or its community.

This includes but is not limited to: comment trolling, botting likes, hacking, harassment, deceiving behaviour, slowing down the servers, or anything else damaging to the game. Similarity, attempting to do any of these is not allowed.

## 5. Do not abuse voice channel, streaming, or music privileges.

Avoid mic and music abuse, keep livestreams appropriate, keep songs appropriate, avoid adding extended or looped songs to the queue, and avoid playing loud or shocking noises.

Failure to follow these guidelines will result in consequences ranging from warnings to permanent bans. Report any rule-breaking behaviour to staff. All deleted and edited messages are viewable by staff.

The safety of the server and our members is of our utmost importance. If staff notice a potential threat such as deceiving or malicious behavior, they will take action. You are expected to use common sense and be a good member of our community.

Please also be sure to follow Discord's [Terms of Service]() and [Community Guidelines]().
