# Changelog

<p class="alert">You can view this <a href="https://github.com/MoldyMacaroniX/MoldyMacaroniX-Personal-Website">website's source code</a> on GitHub.</p>

## v2.0: A bunch of little fixes.

* My Discord server rules have [moved once again](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ocPJN3eUK6OSv4PvypYauZ5n_YtdhRSfxZApPuzbMY0/edit?usp=sharing).
* A bunch of little fixes, whether it was inconsistencies or outdated information.

## v1.0: Another New Beginning!

So I redesigned and completely rebuilt the site... again. I know that the old site hadn't even been around for a year yet, but I wanted to turn this project *into something more.* By that, I mean I started a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MoldyMacaroniX/MoldyMacaroniX-Personal-Website) for this place and rebuilt it entirely with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). Here is a list of some notable differences between this new site and the previous version.

* Replaced the frequently asked questions page with a brand new [about page](/about/)! I may add a new FAQ page in the future though.
* Scrapped the website news board originally found on the [community page](/community/). It was pretty pointless.
* Completely scrapped the DeltaStorm page. It was also pretty pointless.
* Beautiful links, thanks to the way Eleventy generates content! (`videos.html` becomes `/videos/`) This might cause old links to break though, leading to the 404 page.
* My [Discord Server Rules](/server/) are now back online.
* My [web tools](/tools/) are now under `/tools/`. This means, for example, if you want to go to my [unique idea generator](/tools/unique-idea-generator/), you have to go to `moldymacaronix.netlify.app/tools/unique-idea-generator/`.
* Removed CoverFrame. That was a good riddance.

And for some behind the scenes stuff...

* Most pages are now written in markdown! This makes the pages and the site as a whole much, *much* easier to manage. This means this place can finally grow in directions that it couldn't previously.
* This website is now built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). I've always loved this SSG, so finally being able to use it in a project is great.
* No CMS yet but I may consider getting one down the line.
* You can now find this [website's source code](https://github.com/MoldyMacaroniX/MoldyMacaroniX-Personal-Website) on GitHub, just in case you want to see it for whatever reason.
