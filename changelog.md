## v1.0: Another New Beginning!

So I redesigned and completely rebuilt the site... again. I know that the old site hasn't even been around for a year yet, but I wanted to turn this project *into something more.* By that, I mean I started a [GitHub repository]() for this place and rebuilt it entirely with [Eleventy](). Here is a list of some notable differences between this new site and the previous version.

* Replaced the frequently asked questions page with a brand new [about page]()! This one still features some of the most common FAQs though.
* Scrapped the website news board originally found on the [community page](). It was pretty pointless.
* Completely scrapped the DeltaStorm page. It was also pretty pointless.

And for some behind the scenes stuff...

* Most pages are now written in markdown! This makes the pages and the site as a whole much, *much* easier to manage. This means this place can finally grow in directions that it couldn't previously.
