## v1.0: Another New Beginning!

So I redesigned and completely rebuilt the site... again. I know that the old site hadn't even been around for a year yet, but I wanted to turn this project *into something more.* By that, I mean I started a [GitHub repository]() for this place and rebuilt it entirely with [Eleventy](). Here is a list of some notable differences between this new site and the previous version.

* Replaced the frequently asked questions page with a brand new [about page]()! I may add a new FAQ page in the future though.
* Scrapped the website news board originally found on the [community page](). It was pretty pointless.
* Completely scrapped the DeltaStorm page. It was also pretty pointless.
* My [Discord Server Rules]() are now back online.
* My [web tools]() are now under `/tools/`. This means, for example, if you want to go to my [unique idea generator](), you have to go to `moldymacaronix.netlify.app/tools/unique-idea-generator/`.
* Removed CoverFrame. That was a good riddance.

And for some behind the scenes stuff...

* Most pages are now written in markdown! This makes the pages and the site as a whole much, *much* easier to manage. This means this place can finally grow in directions that it couldn't previously.
* This website is now built with [Eleventy](). I've always loved this SSG, so finally being able to use it in a project is great.
* No CMS yet but I may consider getting one down the line.
* You can now find this [website's source code]() on GitHub, just in case you want to see it for whatever reason.
