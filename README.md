# Welcome to my personal website repository!

This is the repository for my [personal website](). You are probably here because you want to see the source code. In that regard, **I apologize for the most-likely horrible code.** But at the end of the day, everything seems to work, so that's all I could ask for.

> Project is still work in progress.

## Site Details

* This site was built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).
* Yeah, that's pretty much it.

## Running a local copy of this site.

Good luck. I think you, uh, clone this repository, and then just run it or something? Look, I'm not good at this kind of stuff. Not sure why you would even want a local copy of this site anyway.
