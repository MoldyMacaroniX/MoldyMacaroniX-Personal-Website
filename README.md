# Welcome to my personal website repository!

This is the repository for my [personal website](https://moldymacaronix.netlify.app/). You are probably here because you want to see the source code. In that regard, **I apologize for the most-likely horrible code.** But at the end of the day, everything seems to work, so that's all I could ask for.

> Project is still work in progress. (And by extentsion, so is this README.)

## Site Details

* This site was built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).
* Yeah, that's pretty much it.

## Source Code

As mentioned above, I assume you are here to see this website's source code. I will leave this repository as public *for now* since maybe it can help someone. Although, due to how messy and horrible my code probably is, I would say that this is not a good place to get help. There are much better resources out there.

## Running a local copy of this site.

~~Good luck.~~

In all seriousness, I am not an expert on this. I *think* you do the following.

1. Download or clone this repository *or something*.
2. Navigate to this directory.
3. Run `npm i`.
4. Run `npx eleventy --serve`.

If anyone has any actual detailed instructions that work, sharing them would be greatly appreciated!

Not sure why anyone would even want a local copy of this site but it's an option I guess.

## Issues

As of currently, this project is still work in progress. This means there are some little issues that I should fix before I deploy the site. Whether it be little things like links that don't go anywhere or unfinished pages, please excuse these for the time being. If there are any issues that you think I haven't caught yet, feel free to let me know!
