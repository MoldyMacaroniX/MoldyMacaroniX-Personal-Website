# Welcome to my personal website repository!

This is the repository for my [personal website](https://moldymacaronix.netlify.app/). You are probably here because you want to see the source code. In that regard, **I apologize for the most-likely horrible code.** But at the end of the day, everything seems to work, so that's all I could ask for.

> Project is still work in progress. (And by extentsion, so is this README.)

## Site Details

* This site was built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).
* Yeah, that's pretty much it.

## Running a local copy of this site.

~~Good luck.~~

In all seriousness, I am not an expert on this. I *think* you do the following.

1. Download or clone this repository or something.
2. Navigate to this directory.
3. Run `npm i`.
4. Run `npx eleventy --serve`.

If anyone has more detailed instructions with more technical terms I don't understand, feel free to let me know.
